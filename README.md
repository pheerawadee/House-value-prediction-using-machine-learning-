# House-value-prediction-using-machine-learning-
This project is about creating a machine learning model that can predict the house value based on the given dataset. We use different machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision tree and random forest to train the model, and the model that gives the best performance is used to predict the house value for new data.
